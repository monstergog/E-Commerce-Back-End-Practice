# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Description

A small demo program made to demonstrate the usage of Sequelize using the E-Commerce backend design as a base

## Installation

After downloading the repository, first run `npm install` to get all of the dependencies. Once that is done, create a `.env` file within the `Develop` folder that mimics the contents of the `.env.EXAMPLE` file with your own MySQL credentials. Then you can run `node server.js` to run the program.

## Usage

Once you have installed the program you can access the database with API calls such as with Insomnia (shown in the screenshot below).
